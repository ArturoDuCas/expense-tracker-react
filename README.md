# About this project :outbox_tray:  
For this project I followed a [tutorial](https://youtu.be/XuFDcZABiDQ) from youtuber [Traversy Media](https://www.youtube.com/@TraversyMedia) to practice the use of hooks (useState, useContext, useReducer) and the context API. For that reason I give him his respective credits.  
I started from his application and then implemented some improvements.
### My Implemented Features :blush:  
- Manage the ID state, to assign the next correct value (current + 1).
- Added the edit functionality, for updating existing transactions. 
- Manage to avoid uploading empty transactions (transactions with amount 0 are allowed)
- Show a preview of the transactions performed by pointing the mouse to the IncomeExpenses component.
- Added buttons to hide or show transactions depending on their type (income or expenses).
